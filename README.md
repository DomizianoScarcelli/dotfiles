I'm using:
- `stow` to manage symlinks to have dotfiles all in one place
- `yabai` as a tiling window manager
- `skhd` to map terminal commands to keyboard shortcut. This is helpful to manage yabai windows with the keyboard
- `nvim` as the text editor of choice. I used `vscode` for a long time so I also keep its configuration files here.
- `karabineer-elements` to remap keys
- `ranger` as a terminal file manager
- `tmux` to have multiple terminal windows in a single terminal
- `kitty` as a terminal emulator
- `sketchybar` to have a customizable alternative menu bar on MacOS
- `jankyborders` to have customizable borders on the current active window

### good nvim plugins

- `oil` to edit file tree like a normal nvim buffer
- `lualine` to have some information at the top and bottom of the window
- `undotree` to see a tree of my file undos
- `telescope` as a fuzzy finder
- `todo-comments` to highlight TODOs and other keywords in comments
- `vimtex` to be able to compile LaTeX documents on save
- `vim-commentary` to quicly comment highlighted portions of code
