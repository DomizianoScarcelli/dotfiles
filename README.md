These are my configuration files for MacOS. I'm using `stow` to manage them.

I'm using:
- `stow` to manage symlinks to have dotfiles all in one place
- `yabai` as a tiling window manager
- `skhd` to map terminal commands to keyboard shortcut. This is helpful to manage yabai windows with the keyboard
- `nvim` as the text editor of choice
- `karabineer-elements` to remap keys
- `ranger` as a terminal file manager
- `tmux` to have multiple terminal windows in a single terminal
- `iTerm` as a terminal emulator
- `sketchybar` to have a customizable alternative menu bar on MacOS
